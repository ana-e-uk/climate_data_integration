# Best Practices

Below are the descriptions of the current best practices in the climate/earth science research community for the varying steps of the pipeline.

## General Resources

The following resources discuss the physical sciences of climate science. This will be useful to get a general idea of the data that is necessary and useful for climate scientists.

* Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Sixth Assesment [Report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/) gives an overview of the science driving climate change.
* Encyclopedia of Earth Weather and Climate [Tab](https://editors.eol.org/eoearth/wiki/Weather_%26_Climate) defines various aspects of the weather and climate.

The following resources are to get an idea of the best practices of each of our steps.

* Practical Guide to Climate Econometrics [Introduction](https://climateestimate.net/content/getting-started.html) gives a good introduction into finding and using weather data, common file formats in the field, etc..
* The Spatio-Temporal-Access-Catalog [Index](https://stacspec.org/en) is a specification that provides an API, datasets, etc. that allows data to be handled which we can look at for an example of how to code our software.
* The odc-stac python function [documentation](https://odc-stac.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html) gives an example of an existing python software that helps analyze Sentinel 2 [data](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-2).
* Learning the Earth with Artificial Intelligence and Physics [LEAP](https://leap.columbia.edu) is an NSF science and technology center for integrating physical models and machine learning for climate science. Its documentation may help us to determine how data is best integrated for use in ML, climate science, and data science.
* Earthaccess python [library](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/news/blog/earthaccess-earth-science-data-simplified) is NASA's python library for helping users work with their data, which is the type of data we are interested in integrating with others.
* U.S. Antarctic Program Data [Center]() documents, preserves, and disseminates data from Antarctica, which can be a good example for us in terms of documentation.
